  description: Build a Skirmishers' Camp
  narration:
  - narrator: 1
    content: Well done, General. We have secured supplies to fulfil basic needs of
      our men. We can start equipping them with weapons again, but be careful - when
      fighting, they tend to eat much more and often require additional compensation.
      Turns out even at the brink of annihilation, a little bit of comfort keeps
      the morale high.
  - narrator: 1
    content: If you ever run out of resources to satisfy their needs, they will most
      likely put their weapons down. Which is still a better outcome than starving
      to death in the field, isn't it? They will be willing to get mobilized again,
      but be sure to prepare the initial payment again and stockpile some resources.
  - narrator: 1
    content: Now, let's prepare to move out. Our next goal is further north and to
      achieve it, we will need a strong striking force. We should start by setting
      a training camp - do it wherever you see fit.

    content: Select any available area and build Skirmisher's Camp.
