  narration:
  - narrator: 1
    content: Look at, our small kingdom expands! We will have to wait for our lumberjacks
      to do their job, so in the meantime, I suggest you get familiar with the information
      our subordinates are reporting, General. Getting used to managing the perspective
      on these matters won't hurt as well.

    content: <i>When your kingdom expands, you may need to adjust the camera to see
      and manage it better. You can move it freely by dragging your finger across
      the screen. Use two fingers to change the level of zoom.</i>
  - narrator: 0
    content: '<i>When you are done adjusting the camera, take a look at the top of
      the screen. You will find information about resources in your kingdom: first
      number tells you how much is stocked in the warehouses, the second how much
      of those you will gain (or lose) each 10 seconds.</i>'
